# Integrating Domain Knowledge into Transformer-based Approaches to Vulnerability Detection

TransVulDet is a Transformer-based Language Model for Vulnerability Detection aiming to better domain knowledge interation (e.g. CWE hierarchy) with source code datasets.

### Dataset
* Multiclass Vulnerability Dataset (MVD)
  * 40 CWEs, multiclass
* Big-Vul dataset
  * 91 CWE, small
* CVEfixes Dataset
  * 209 CWEs
